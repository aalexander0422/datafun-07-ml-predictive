In this final module, you'll employ machine learning (ML). At a high-level, there are three general categories of ML: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We'll employ a type of supervised learning, simple linear regression, to train a model using all available data and use the resulting model (a best-fit straight line) to make predictions. 

We will use regression to predict the temperature in NY duiring the month of january
